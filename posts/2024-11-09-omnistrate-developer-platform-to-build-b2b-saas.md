Omnistrate offers the world’s first developer platform that simplifies and speeds up the development of B2B SaaS. It streamlines tenant and infrastructure management, including application deployment, empowering developers, product owners, and DevOps and MLOps teams to work more efficiently.

**Who**:

- Developers: Quickly build and deploy B2B applications by offloading tenant and infra management, or deploy your existing app anywhere (cloud or on-prem)
- Product Owners: Turn your B2B app into a SaaS solution
- DevOps Teams: Co-pilot backend operations to automate undifferentiated tasks
- Data Science/MLOps: Push more models to production, ensuring access to compute and visibility over ML workloads.

**Why**: Developing a SaaS platform from scratch can take months or even years. The path to product-market fit is fraught with costly iterations and experimentation. Add to this the cloud complexity of managing diverse services, providers, regions, accounts, and customer isolation requirements, and the journey becomes exponentially more challenging. This operational burden diverts valuable engineering resources from innovation and slows down time-to-market.

**What**: Omnistrate accelerates SaaS development by automating the creation and management of a control plane, saving years of development time and resources. By abstracting cloud complexities, it empowers engineering teams to focus on their core offerings. With out-of-the-box integrations into all major cloud providers and the ability to adapt to evolving business needs, Omnistrate ensures scalability, reliability, and agility at every stage of the journey. 

**How**: Users start by bringing their model and application through container images or K8s artifacts (Helm, Operator, Kustomize, Terraform). Omnistrate builds and deploys a fully customized  control plane directly in the user's account. This control plane manages tenants, deployments, infrastructure, while automating critical operations such as  scaling, patching, metering, billing, security, observability, backups, monitoring, high-availability, and compliance. It also integrates with users’ preferred tools, simplifying complex processes, allowing users to focus on what truly matters.
