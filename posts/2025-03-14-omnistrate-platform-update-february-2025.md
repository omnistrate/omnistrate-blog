## üöÄ Exciting New Features in Omnistrate


![Omnistrate Updates](https://mcusercontent.com/08ffbac64293e1abc50999571/images/7de911d9-0281-faf9-9023-c27ff9e01d1f.png)

We‚Äôre thrilled to introduce several powerful updates that enhance the Omnistrate platform!

**Licensing Protection System**

We are thrilled to introduce the **Omnistrate Licensing Protection System**‚Äîa robust solution that ensures only authorized, subscribed customers can deploy and use your software while preventing abuse. This is especially crucial for BYOA, BYOC, and on-premises environments. By enforcing subscription compliance, the system prevents unauthorized deployments by ensuring your software does not start without a valid license. See a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-P8fLZrN18) on how the system works and explore our [examples](https://docs.omnistrate.com/build-guides/licensing-protection/#examples).  

**Scheduled Upgrades**

Additionally, we‚Äôve released a new feature that allows you to **schedule software upgrades and automate customer** notifications and progress tracking. This enhancement streamlines the upgrade process by letting you set the timing for upgrades and automatically informing customers of the status and progress. With real-time updates and seamless communication, you can ensure a smooth and efficient upgrade experience for both your team and customers, saving time and enhancing satisfaction.  

**Cost Control & Insights**

Also, we are thrilled to introduce our new **Cost Control and Insights**, designed to give you complete visibility and control over your infrastructure and tenant costs. With this powerful tool, you can explore and analyze cost breakdowns, identify optimization opportunities, and take actionable steps to reduce expenses. Leverage savings from strategies like spot-instances and more to maximize cost efficiency. Gain valuable insights to help you optimize and manage your costs, ensuring you stay in control and make the most out of your resources.  


#### Additional Improvements  


- **Custom sidecar support** allows you to enhance your SaaS product's functionality without changing its core service. Think of them as add-on containers that run alongside your main application. You can add new features or capabilities by attaching sidecar containers, use existing open-source implementations as sidecars, deploy your own custom implementations as sidecars, and run multiple sidecars with each resource instance.

  Learn more about how [custom sidecars](https://docs.omnistrate.com/build-guides/custom-sidecars/#custom-sidecars) can enhance your SaaS product by exploring our [blog](https://blog.omnistrate.com/posts/130).

- Omnistrate's **Debug Mode** enhances the development experience with Terraform by allowing real-time interaction with ongoing deployments, enabling quick troubleshooting and fixes without needing to restart or upgrade the entire deployment. This feature is ideal for testing Terraform scripts or applying urgent fixes while maintaining deployment continuity, improving efficiency and reducing downtime. See debug mode in action in a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfI8BSp2XNY) and learn more by exploring our [documentation](https://docs.omnistrate.com/operate-guides/operational-insights/#debug-mode).

- Improved **visibility into Omnistrate cost**, providing real time visibility into Omnistrate usage.

- Improved support for **Terraform on GCP**, making it easier to set up custom policies to execute Terraform stacks.

- Enhanced **Terraform developer experience** with better error reporting and improved usability.

- Reminder: As announced in the previous newsletter, **Cloud Shell** is now the only supported way to onboard GCP Cloud Accounts into Omnistrate

- Other UX improvements:

    - Improved the consistency of **health status**, ensuring more reliable and accurate reporting across all systems for better monitoring and management.
    - Deployments created using Helm, Operators and Kustomize now display **endpoints and health** status to end customers.
    - Easily configurable custom **Cookie Policy** for your SaaS Portal, to easily comply with data privacy regulations.
