## Highlights from AWS re:Invent ##


From hosting the SaaS Builders Meet & Greet to going live with an insightful LinkedIn Live podcast on Building AI-Native Data Applications in the Cloud, our week was packed with bold ideas, valuable conversations, and inspiring connections. Here are some of the key themes that resonated:

**üí° Simplifying Cloud Deployments**<br/>
Building in the cloud shouldn‚Äôt be complex‚Äîstreamlined deployments empower teams to innovate faster and scale smarter.

**‚öôÔ∏è Automating SaaS Operations** <br/>
Automated environment management and scaling processes reduce operational overhead, enabling teams to focus on what matters: product development.

**üîí Building with Security at the Core**<br/>
Trust comes from ensuring data protection and system reliability, fostering confident and secure deployments in a cloud-native world.

We are especially grateful to **Peter Zaitsev** (Founder & ex-CEO of Percona) and **Gopi Duddi** (SVP of Engineering at Couchbase) for sharing their invaluable insights during our LinkedIn Live session.

To all the SaaS builders, developers, and innovators we connected with‚Äîthank you for making this an unforgettable experience! We‚Äôre excited to build the future of SaaS together.
