![Omnistrate features][2]

We’re thrilled to introduce several powerful updates that enhance the Omnistrate platform!

Omnistrate now supports **Private Link** in addition to VPC peering. Enable private connections between services, with less complexity. This feature is a game-changer for compliance-critical and performance-driven applications—ensuring your data stays secure and your latency stays low.

Additionally, Omnistrate added support for **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** as a mounted drive. Dive into effortless integrating your application with GCS to provide a cost effective and reliable data storage solution for your service without changing your application code. 

Lastly, we’ve enhanced our Day-2 support for **complex resource types like Operator, Helm, and Kustomize**. Beyond connectivity and pod details, we now offer greater visibility for both you and your customers. And we’re not stopping there—stay tuned for exciting December updates on what’s coming next!

**Additional Improvements:**

- Omnistrate Cost Dashboard: Comprehensive view of your infrastructure costs when building your SaaS.
- Support for 0 Replicas: Maximize resource flexibility allowing your customers to scale from 0 to N replicas for tailored deployments.
- Endpoint info for Helm, Kustomize and Operator resources: Display deployment endpoint details, improving your customer experience and streamlining operations.
- List Pods for Helm, Kustomize and Operator resources: Gain real-time visibility into your pods from the UI, without having to connect to Kubernetes to gather information.
- Stream Logs for Helm, Kustomize and Operator resources: Debug and monitor efficiently and conveniently with live log streaming accessible in the UI. 
- Code Editor Auto-Complete: Intuitive autocomplete for system and environment variables.
- Enhanced Backup and Restore: Effortlessly manage backups with a revamped, user-friendly interface.
- SaaSBuilder Navigation Overhaul: Enjoy smoother navigation with key menu items relocated for better organization.
- Prominent Workflow Step Statuses: Stay informed with clearer and more accessible workflow step updates.
- Always-Visible Account Configuration: No more searching—account details are now always in view.
- Updated Health Status Interface: The new status indicator delivers a clearer, more intuitive representation of health states.
- Network Type Support: Launch instances with custom network configurations for greater control.

## Highlights from AWS re:Invent ##


From hosting the SaaS Builders Meet & Greet to going live with an insightful LinkedIn Live podcast on Building AI-Native Data Applications in the Cloud, our week was packed with bold ideas, valuable conversations, and inspiring connections. Here are some of the key themes that resonated:

**💡 Simplifying Cloud Deployments**
Building in the cloud shouldn’t be complex—streamlined deployments empower teams to innovate faster and scale smarter.

**⚙️ Automating SaaS Operations** 
Automated environment management and scaling processes reduce operational overhead, enabling teams to focus on what matters: product development.

**🔒 Building with Security at the Core**
Trust comes from ensuring data protection and system reliability, fostering confident and secure deployments in a cloud-native world.

We are especially grateful to **Peter Zaitsev** (Founder & ex-CEO of Percona) and **Gopi Duddi** (SVP of Engineering at Couchbase) for sharing their invaluable insights during our LinkedIn Live session.

To all the SaaS builders, developers, and innovators we connected with—thank you for making this an unforgettable experience! We’re excited to build the future of SaaS together.
