## üöÄ Exciting New Features in Omnistrate


![Omnistrate Updates](/images/posts/omnistrate-platform-update-july-2025-edition-1.png)

We‚Äôve expanded the power and flexibility of deployment cell management, giving you greater control over how workloads are isolated, maintained, and accessed. These improvements reduce operational friction, strengthen governance, and ensure your teams can work faster and smarter.

You can now **securely access, visualize, and delete your Deployment Cells** directly from your Control Plane, eliminating the need for complex networking workarounds or manual cluster access setups‚Äîeven for BYOC deployments. This capability gives your teams faster, more reliable entry points for troubleshooting and operational changes. By reducing the friction in reaching isolated workloads, you cut resolution times, improve service availability, and empower your operations teams to act with agility, whether managing a single tenant or an entire fleet.

You can now seamlessly **adopt existing Helm chart deployments** as Omnistrate-managed deployment instances without costly rework or downtime. By adopting these workloads as native resource instances, you gain centralized control, consistent governance, and unified monitoring across all environments‚Äîcloud or on-prem.

This streamlined onboarding reduces operational overhead, accelerates time-to-value, and ensures that even legacy deployments benefit from Omnistrate‚Äôs automation, security, and lifecycle management capabilities.

We‚Äôve taken your feedback to heart and introduced the **Interactive Debug Tool**, designed to make diagnosing deployment issues simpler and faster for services constructed with Terraform. Instead of combing through logs or manually tracing configurations, you can now interactively inspect resources and logs in a user-friendly interface. This drastically shortens troubleshooting cycles and reduces operational overhead.


### Additional Improvements


**Build faster**

- **Webhook Debug Tools**: Trace payloads, inspect delivery attempts, and replay events.
- **Sidecar Security Capability Support**: Apply capability to security context settings for sidecar containers, enabling finer-grained control over their permissions and runtime behavior.
- **New System Parameters for Environment ID / Type**: A new system parameter now exposes environment ID and type, making it easier to automate environment-specific workflows.

**Improved operations**

- **Delete and Manage Deployment Cells**: Full control over your deployment cells, including deletion and reorganization directly from Omnistrate.
- **Audit Log for Nodepool Cleanup**: Every nodepool cleanup action is now recorded in an audit log, giving you full visibility into infrastructure changes.
- **Failover Notifications**: Subscribe to failover notifications and receive real-time alerts whenever services switch over for resiliency.

**Improve your service reliability**

- **Pod Disruption Budgets for Improved Availability**: Omnistrate now automatically applies Pod Disruption Budgets to Compose-defined services to protect against multiple pods becoming unavailable during node draining or maintenance.

**Improve your Customer Portal**

- **Regex Validation for API Parameters**: Supports regex-based validation for API parameters directly within the customer portal‚Äîno coding required. Enforce precise input formats for APIs and deployment forms.

**Better usability for your team**

- **Version Set Name Management**: Rename version sets directly, giving more flexibility in organizing and managing your deployments.
- **Public documentation as machine-readable**: Omnistrate now exposes its public documentation as a machine-readable file at [https://docs.omnistrate.com/llms.txt](https://docs.omnistrate.com/llms.txt), making it directly accessible to LLMs and other AI tools.

Omnistrate helps you turn AI applications into scalable platforms that can be distributed with ease. By handling deployment, scaling, and customer management, it lets you focus on building AI innovation while reaching more users faster. Check the latest features and updates to help you do that:


### Transform AI Infrastructure Deployment from Months to Minutes


We‚Äôre excited to showcase how Omnistrate can ‚Äúprint‚Äù complete NVIDIA AI/ML platforms across multiple clouds with a single specification. This comprehensive demo features the full NVIDIA OSS stack: TAO Toolkit for training, Dynamo for inference, MinIO for model storage, and Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring.

The specification deploys production-ready infrastructure across AWS, GCP, and Azure GPU-enabled machines with enterprise-grade features including auto-scaling, multi-tenant isolation, and Omnistrate‚Äôs optimized node topology. What traditionally takes months of engineering work across multiple teams now deploys in minutes with a single command.

This demo illustrates Omnistrate‚Äôs ‚ÄúControl Plane as a Service‚Äù approach, enabling teams to build AI/ML pipelines as platforms with full tenant isolation control while Omnistrate handles all infrastructure management. Whether serving external customers or internal teams, the same platform specification provides 10√ó faster time-to-market and 90% reduced operational overhead.

Perfect for AI/ML teams, platform engineers, and anyone curious about declarative, multi-cloud AI infrastructure. The complete specification, documentation, and deployment guides are available in our community GitHub:

[üëâ Check the full service specification](https://github.com/omnistrate-community/nvidia-oss-ai-ml-tech-example)

Ready to ‚Äúprint‚Äù your own AI platform? Explore the demo, try it in your environment, and see how Omnistrate makes enterprise-grade AI infrastructure surprisingly simple.


### Cost Insights improvements


Omnistrate‚Äôs Cost Insights now provides granular visibility into AI workflows, showing infrastructure usage per deployment, per customer, and per resource‚Äîincluding GPU consumption. This allows teams to identify underutilized GPUs, right-size deployments, and optimize costs without sacrificing performance.


### Maximize GPU utilization with Slicing and MIG


Modern AI infrastructure can significantly reduce costs and improve GPU resource utilization through smart sharing strategies like time-slicing and NVIDIA‚Äôs Multi-Instance GPU (MIG). Read more on the benefits of using such technologies on our [recent blog](https://blog.omnistrate.com/posts/155).

Implementing such strategies manually involves considerable complexity, but platforms like Omnistrate streamline deployment, orchestration, and ongoing management. Learn how to configure your service to leverage these technologies in our [technical documentation](https://docs.omnistrate.com/infra-guides/gpu-slicing/).

At Omnistrate, we‚Äôre committed to empowering developers and simplifying the journey of building SaaS. Our latest updates to our community projects present how to solve common problems to integrate with Cloud Marketplaces.

This [example](https://docs.omnistrate.com/examples/integrate-billing-with-marketplace/) shows how to integrate SaaS billing with cloud marketplaces, including automated usage metering, subscription management, and exporting data for analysis. As an example of how to integrate with marketplaces, we have an open-source [Clazar usage export recipe](https://github.com/omnistrate-community/usage-export-clazar-recipe), which automates exporting metered to Clazar contracts, streamlining billing workflows.

These resources are open-source and serve as practical guides for developers implementing marketplace billing and usage tracking in SaaS applications using any marketplace or any marketplace provider.
