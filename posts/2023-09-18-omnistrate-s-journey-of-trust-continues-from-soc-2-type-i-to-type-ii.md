**Certification**

We are back with more exciting news. After our proud [announcement][1] of achieving the SOC 2 Type I certification, we have now achieved another significant milestone by earning the SOC 2 Type II Certification. This milestone underscores our commitment to creating a safer, more secure environment for our clients and their data.

**Revisiting the Importance of SOC 2 Certification**

System and Organization Controls 2 (SOC 2) is an auditing procedure developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) to ensure service providers securely manage data to protect the interests and privacy of their clients. Type 2 certification specifically examines and attests to the operational effectiveness of a service provider's controls over a defined period.

**Why SOC 2 Type II is Important**

While our earlier SOC 2 Type I compliance showcased our commitment to implementing the right security practices and policies, the Type II certification takes this a step further. It signifies not only our adherence to these robust controls but also their effectiveness over time. Essentially it means that we're not just good at creating secure systems; we excel at ensuring they remain secure every single day. It demonstrates our consistency in ensuring the highest levels of security, availability, and confidentiality of customer data.

**Our Journey to SOC 2 Type II Certification**

Achieving this certification required a rigorous, in-depth examination of our practices over a set period by external auditors. During this time, Omnistrate persistently emphasized the following

 - Security Training - Ensuring all our employees are well-equipped with
   up-to-date security knowledge. 
 - Robust Cloud Architecture - Offering secure environments with features like unique encryption keys, data
   isolation, and role-based access controls to guarantee data safety.
 - Continuous Monitoring and Threat Detection - Continuous monitoring,logging, alerts, tests and threat detection on our systems ensuring our clients' data remains protected.
