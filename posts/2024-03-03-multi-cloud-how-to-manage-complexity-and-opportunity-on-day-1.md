There are several advantage of running services across multiple clouds. Many organization don't consider this initially due to added complexity, effort and management cost. Is there a way to have a cake and eat it too?

Before we dive into how to achieve the best of the both worlds. Here are some of the advantages:

- Redundancy and High Availability: Operating across multiple cloud providers mitigates the risk of downtime due to outages or failures in a single cloud region or provider.

- Performance Optimization: Leveraging multiple cloud providers allows you to deploy resources closer to your users, optimizing latency and improving overall performance.

- Cost Optimization: By distributing workloads across different cloud platforms, you can take advantage of pricing variations, discounts, and promotions offered by different providers, optimizing costs based on workload requirements.

- Vendor Lock-In Mitigation: Operating across multiple clouds reduces dependency on a single cloud provider, mitigating the risk of vendor lock-in and providing flexibility to switch providers if needed. For example - having this option at the renewal time will give you the flexibility to get the right deal with the cloud providers.

- Compliance and Data Residency: Running SaaS across multiple clouds enables compliance with data residency requirements by allowing data to reside in specific geographic regions or adhere to regulatory mandates.

- Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity: Multi-cloud architectures facilitate robust disaster recovery and business continuity strategies, ensuring data and services remain accessible even in the event of a catastrophic failure in one cloud environment.

- Innovation and Ecosystem Access: Accessing different cloud ecosystems enables you to leverage unique services, features, and innovations offered by each provider, fostering innovation and differentiation in your SaaS offerings.

- Global Reach and Scalability: Multi-cloud deployments enable global reach and scalability by allowing you to leverage cloud resources in various regions worldwide, supporting expansion and accommodating fluctuations in demand effectively.

In summary, running SaaS across multiple clouds provides resilience, performance optimization, cost efficiency, compliance adherence, and access to diverse ecosystems, empowering organizations to deliver robust and scalable services to their users.

Now, back to achieving both the short and long term goals. We need a better abstraction to hide the low level cloud details and allow us to build our tech stack independent of the cloud providers. At Omnistrate, we are making it simpler for platform teams to build their services multi-cloud and no longer make that tradeoff.
