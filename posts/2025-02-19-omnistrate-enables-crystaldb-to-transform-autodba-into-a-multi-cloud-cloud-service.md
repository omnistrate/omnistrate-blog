**About CrystalDB**

CrystalDB specializes in providing accessible expertise for reliable and efficient PostgreSQL management, catering to organizations of all sizes, budgets, and levels of PostgreSQL experience.
While cloud Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) solutions like Amazon RDS and Google Cloud SQL simplify PostgreSQL deployment, they often leave users to handle complex management tasks, including:

- Resource and scalability planning

- Optimizing query plans and indexing for performance

- Configuring maintenance tasks such as vacuuming

- Setting up redundancy to meet reliability goals

- Adjusting numerous configuration parameters with interdependent effects

These challenges require context-specific decisions based on factors like query patterns and data growth. AutoDBA addresses these issues by translating various inputs into effective management actions.


**The Challenge**

CrystalDB faced several challenges in evolving AutoDBA from an on-premises solution (Software) to a user-friendly multi-cloud offer:

- **Ease of Deployment**: AutoDBA needed to be simple to deploy, manage, scale, and secure to fulfill its mission of simplifying customers' workflows.

- **Real-Time Metrics Collection**: Continuous monitoring of system and database metrics, varying across environments, was essential. 

- **Scalability and Reliability**: A growing user base demanded a cost optimized, scalable, highly available solution to prevent service interruptions.

- **Seamless Multi-Cloud Integration**: Ensuring consistent performance and connectivity across multiple cloud platforms and on-premises environments was vital for a smooth user experience.


**The Solution: Omnistrate’s Control Plane as a Service**

Omnistrate's services enabled CrystalDB to overcome these challenges, delivering AutoDBA as a reliable SaaS solution. Key benefits included:

- **Unified Management Across Environments**: Omnistrate allowed CrystalDB to centralize AutoDBA's management, streamlining operations across various PostgreSQL deployments without the need for custom configurations.
