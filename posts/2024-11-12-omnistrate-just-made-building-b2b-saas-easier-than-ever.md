At Omnistrate, we’ve been hard at work expanding our platform to make B2B SaaS development as seamless as possible. Over the past few months, we’ve added support for Helm, Operator, Terraform, and Kustomize. These tools have empowered our advanced users to quickly bring their artifacts and launch their B2B SaaS platforms with ease and efficiency.

But what about those who are just starting their SaaS journey? We started with “bring your own Compose specification” support, but for full functionality, a few custom Compose extensions were needed. Recognizing the need for simplicity, we added support for container images to make getting started easier.

Today, we’re taking simplicity to the next level.


### Announcing “Bring Your Own Repo”


We’re excited to announce support for “Bring Your Own Repo”—making SaaS development as easy as running a single command. With Omnistrate, all you need to do is bring your code repository and run omnistrate-ctl to build a default SaaS configuration for you. It’s fast, intuitive, and sets you up with a base SaaS structure that you can further customize and extend as you grow. Building SaaS has never been easier than with a single command against your repo.
