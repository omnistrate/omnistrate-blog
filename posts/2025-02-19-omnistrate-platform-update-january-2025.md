## ðŸš€ Exciting New Features in Omnistrate


![Omnistrate Updates](/images/posts/omnistrate-platform-update-january-2025-1.png)

Weâ€™re thrilled to introduce several powerful updates that enhance the Omnistrate platform!

**Revamped SaaSBuilder**

We have revamped **SaaSBuilder**! The customer portal where your users access and manage SaaS offerings now offers a faster, more intuitive experience. With a unified interface, improved visibility, and optimized workflows, users can manage deployments effortlessly. We have also improved visibility across subscriptions and resources, making it easier to track and monitor deployments. Experience a smoother, more efficient way to interact with your SaaS offerings. See a [demo of the reimagined SaaSBuidler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isTGi8tQA2w) on our YouTube channel.

**Google Cloud Shell Support**

Omnistrate now supports **Google Cloud Shell** for onboarding GCP Cloud Accounts, streamlining the setup process with a secure, browser-based terminal. This enables users to quickly configure and integrate their GCP environments without needing local installations or complex configurations. By leveraging Cloud Shell, Omnistrate ensures a seamless and efficient onboarding experience, allowing teams to focus on deploying and managing their cloud resources with minimal friction. To see a demo on how to set up your GCP Cloud account, visit our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isTGi8tQA2w).

**New Action Hooks**

We have introduced new **action hooks** to support more complex scenarios such as clean shutdowns, upgrade preparations, and long restores. These enhancements provide greater flexibility in managing SaaS operations by allowing customized actions at key lifecycle stages. To see the full list of available action hooks and how they can be implemented, visit our [documentation](https://docs.omnistrate.com/build-guides/actionhooks/).

**_Deprecation Notice_**

In **30 days**, we will be **removing the capability to onboard Cloud Accounts with Terraform for GCP**, making Google Cloud Shell the preferred method for onboarding new GCP Cloud Accounts. This change ensures the best onboarding experience. Existing onboarded accounts will not be affected, but the Terraform stack will not receive further updates.


### Additional Improvements ###


- **AWS Cloud Account Onboarding:** CloudFormation is now the only supported method for onboarding AWS Cloud Accounts.
- Added support for specifying memory and CPU requests/limits as configurable parameters for multi-tenant offerings.

- Improved consistency on the instance and **fleet health status** reporting.
- Reduced permissions for onboarding Cloud Service Accounts for **Bring Your Own Account (BYOA)**.
- Added the capability to **delete customer accounts**.
- New **Bootstrap debug events** included on the workflows, providing visibility into deployment cell setup.
- Introduced comprehensive **audit logging across all services**.
- **Enhanced Fleet UI** with improved observability, refined health status indicators, alerts in instance view, and predefined filters for improved Fleet management.
- **Other UX Improvements**
    - Simplified **Storage Resource** creation and management.
    - Added **subscription details** to Alarm Notifications.
    - Enabled **renaming** of Custom Network configurations.
