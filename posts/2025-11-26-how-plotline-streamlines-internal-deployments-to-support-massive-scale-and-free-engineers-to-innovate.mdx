  <SectionText>
    Plotline's business is built to handle massive scale. Serving high-stakes industries like fintech and gaming, the
    platform processes over <b>1.5 billion API calls</b> daily and serves over 700 million monthly impressions. To
    provide a simple "no-code" experience to its customers, Plotline must manage an incredibly complex, high-stakes
    technical backend.
    <br />
    As the company scaled, their homegrown infrastructure began to show cracks, creating operational friction that
    threatened to slow innovation.

  <SectionTopic>The Solution</SectionTopic>
  <SectionHeading>A Pre-Built Internal Delivery Platform</SectionHeading>
  <SectionText>
    Plotline's leadership faced a strategic "build vs. buy" decision. They recognized that their competitive advantage
    was their customer-facing application, not building internal DevOps tooling. Instead of diverting significant
    engineering time to build a platform from scratch, they chose Omnistrate as their [Internal Delivery Platform
    (IDP)](https://docs.omnistrate.com/usecases/internal-saas/).
    <br />
    Omnistrate provided a complete, pre-built, and unified platform that solved Plotline's operational challenges
    immediately.

  <SectionText>
    By adopting Omnistrate, Plotline transformed its internal operations from a growing bottleneck into an accelerator
    for business growth. The engineering team was freed from undifferentiated heavy lifting and could refocus on what
    matters most: building their core product.

  <SectionTopic>Why Omnistrate</SectionTopic>
  <SectionHeading>Why Plotline Selected Omnistrate</SectionHeading>
  <SectionText>
    Plotline chose Omnistrate for its ability to deliver a <b>complete, pre-built, and unified platform</b> that worked
    immediately.
    <br />
    A DIY (Do-It-Yourself) approach would have required hiring specialized, expensive DevOps talent and taken months to
    build—all to reinvent a wheel that wasn't core to their business.
    <br />
    Omnistrate provided an immediate solution that solved their complex operational and governance challenges, allowing
    Plotline to bypass a costly and time-consuming build and get straight to the business of scaling.
