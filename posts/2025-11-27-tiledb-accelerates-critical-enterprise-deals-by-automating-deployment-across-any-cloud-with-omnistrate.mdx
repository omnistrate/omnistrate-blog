  <SectionHeading>Aligning an Innovative Platform with Enterprise Deployment Needs</SectionHeading>
  <SectionText>
    TileDB developed the revolutionary <b>Carrara omnimodal data platform</b>, which is uniquely designed for the
    complex data needs of regulated industries like Healthcare & Life Sciences (HLS). While TileDB's product was a
    perfect fit for this market, their deployment model needed to evolve to meet the stringent requirements of their
    largest-scale customers.
    <br />
    These high-value enterprises, including major pharmaceutical and hospital networks, have strict data sovereignty and
    compliance needs (e.g., HIPAA). Their policies <b>require</b> that platforms like TileDB run inside their own
    private cloud accounts—a model known as ["Bring Your Own Cloud"
    (BYOC)](https://docs.omnistrate.com/usecases/byoc-copilot/).
    <br />
    This presented a strategic opportunity and a set of new requirements for TileDB:

            . This path also creates significant, ongoing <b>Day 2 operational overhead</b>—forcing teams to manage monitoring,
            upgrades, and compliance—which would have diverted resources from the core Carrara platform and <b>
              significantly delayed time-to-market
            </b> for BYOC and Azure support.

  <SectionHeading>Why TileDB Selected Omnistrate</SectionHeading>
  <SectionText>
    TileDB's reputation in Healthcare & Life Sciences rests on guaranteeing ironclad data sovereignty. They recognized
    that engineering a truly enterprise-grade control plane—with the advanced compliance and governance features their
    customers demand, and a pathway to self-service marketplace deployments—was a different challenge entirely.
    <br />
    Omnistrate was the only partner that provided these critical features as-a-service, eliminating the risk and delay
    of a "DIY" build. This strategic choice allowed TileDB to immediately and confidently meet enterprise requirements
    on Azure, all while keeping their core engineers focused on the Carrara platform.
