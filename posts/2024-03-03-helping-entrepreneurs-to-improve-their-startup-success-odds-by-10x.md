As entrepreneurs, we know that time and money are our most valuable assets. Imagine if we have a mechanism to test our ideas and validate them in no time without spending a fortune. Huh? -- that's interesting!

### Time

The most important asset as entrepreneurs is time. Fundraising, product development, recruiting, user acquisitionâ€”the to-do list seems endless. 

Unlike other things, **time wasted today can never be regained**. Especially in the early stages, when every moment counts towards refining our product and finding market fit, time becomes even more precious.

Let's remember to respect and value our time as a finite resource. Every minute invested wisely brings us closer to our entrepreneurial goals. Time is our currency for success!


### Cash

Secondly, cash is the lifeline that fuels innovation and growth. It's the oxygen that keeps the entrepreneurial spirit alive. But in the world of startups, every dollar counts, and how you spend your cash can make or break your journey to success.

Being wise in how you allocate your resources is crucial. It's not just about cutting costs; it's about investing strategically in areas that drive **differentiated** value and propel your business forward. 

Whether it's product development, marketing initiatives, or talent acquisition, every expenditure should be a calculated step towards achieving your goals of finding PMF (Product market fit).


### SaaS Strategy


Your #1 goal as a startup is to find PMF as quickly as possible and then grow it from there. One of the challenges with finding PMF is to have customers quickly try and provide feedback. SaaS is a goto distribution channel to find PMF by making it easier for your customers to try, adopt and provide feedback. By building your SaaS, you can quickly validate and monetize your ideas without spending a fortune!

But building one is really costly and time-consuming. It used to be only the big guys with lots of money who could build SaaS. At Omnistrate, we are helping entrepreneurs and enterprises build their managed SaaS offering faster than ever before and helping save them years of effort, forever burden to maintain the undifferentiated tech. It's like having a differentiated strategy to succeed in the competitive world of software and stay ahead in the fast-paced world of technology.

You will be able to move faster, find PMF quicker, iterate quickly, provide a unique competitive advantage over incumbents, achieve significantly better margins, and keep your team focused on the things that differentiates your business the most.
