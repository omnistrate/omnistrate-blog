Many B2B startups start their cloud journey with AWS ECS or GCP Cloud Run. It's understandable‚Äîthey're familiar, quick to set up, and tightly integrated with the hyperscalers' ecosystems. Throw in some Terraform, and you have a hello-world deployment workflow that seems "good enough" to get your SaaS up and running.

But "good enough" quickly breaks down as you scale.


### ‚ö†Ô∏è The Hidden Pain That Emerges


As your B2B SaaS gains traction, cracks begin to show:

 - No self-serve deployments with integrated billing
 - No support for tenant-aware deployments or infra management
 - No support for BYOC (deploying in your customers' account) or OnPrem environments
 - No support for multi-cloud environments
 - Manual Terraform pipelines with brittle logic, poor rollback support,
   and little governance
 - Lack of Day-2 automation: No out-of-the-box support for patching,
   upgrades, or lifecycle management
 - No versioning to track changes and make upgrades manageable


You end up stitching together scripts, dashboards, and internal tools‚Äîburning engineering cycles on non-differentiated infrastructure work.


### üß† Why Omnistrate Is 10x Better:


Omnistrate was purpose-built to solve these exact challenges. It goes far beyond ECS, Cloud Run, or Terraform‚Äîespecially for startups serious about shipping enterprise-grade B2B SaaS products.

 - Self-service deployments for your customers with integrated billing
 - Tenant-aware automated deployments
 - Multi-cloud + multi-region support by design
 - Deployment model flexibility: fully hosted (deploy in your account), BYOC (deploy in your customers account), OnPrem CoPilot (deploy in your customers account and give them full control), or air-gapped (deploy in regulated environments)
 - ACID-safe Infra management 
 - In-built versioning to support intelligent upgrades
 - AI-powered and tenant-aware Day-2 operations: monitoring, backups, observability across apps/tenants/deployments/operations,  cost insights and controls, security controls etc.


### üß≠ When Should a B2B Startup Use Omnistrate?


‚úÖ You‚Äôre launching a B2B SaaS Product (self-serve deployments with integrated billing) 

‚úÖ You want to automate your SaaS Ops and scale

‚úÖ You want to scale your GTM (marketplace, co-sell, metering) on cloud marketplaces



### üöÄ TL;DR


ECS/Cloud Run + Terraform may seem simple to start. But Omnistrate lets you build your production-grade SaaS Product.

**Build and grow your B2B SaaS‚Äîin days, not years.**
