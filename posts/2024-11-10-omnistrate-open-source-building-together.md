We’re also expanding our Open Source contributions, fostering community collaboration with new GitHub organizations, and bringing tools and SDKs for a better developer experience.

### [omnistrate-oss][11]


This space hosts a variety of projects and tools designed to help developers leverage the full potential of Omnistrate’s platform. Our goal is to create an ecosystem where contributors can collaborate on building powerful, scalable solutions for cloud-native infrastructure management, continuous delivery, and SaaS development. 

We encourage community involvement, whether it’s through code contributions, issue reporting, or sharing ideas to improve our open-source offerings. 

Some of the projects you can find here are: SaaSBuilder, GitHub Actions, Omnistrate SDK and more


### [omnistrate-community][12]


The code in these repositories is sourced from the Omnistrate user community and reflects contributions from developers who actively use and enhance the platform. 

Some example projects are examples on how to set up a DBaaS service, how to use Helm with Omnistrate and how to setup your CI/CD pipeline on Omnistrate. 


## Call for contributors


As we continue building and expanding our open-source community, we invite developers, contributors, and visionaries to join us on this journey. By collaborating together, we can push the boundaries of what’s possible in cloud-native infrastructure and SaaS development. Whether through contributions, feedback, or new ideas, your involvement helps us shape a more robust, accessible, and innovative ecosystem. Let’s build the future of cloud-native technology—together.
