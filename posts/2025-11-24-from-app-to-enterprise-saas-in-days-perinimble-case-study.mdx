    PeriNimble designed PeriGridAI™ to revolutionize how energy providers interact with smart meters, using AI to
    deliver critical insights for grid reliability, fraud detection, and predictive maintenance.
    <br />
    However, the modern utilities market is fragmented. While some customers want a simple, fully-hosted SaaS solution,
    many larger or regulated utilities have non-negotiable data governance requirements. To succeed, PeriNimble had to
    meet two distinct distribution challenges from day one:

    Rather than dedicating significant time and capital to
    [building](/posts/building-diy-control-planes-with-kubernetes-argocd-terraform-part-1-of-3) a distribution platform,
    PeriNimble made the strategic decision to partner with Omnistrate. They used Omnistrate's [SaaS Control
    Plane](https://omnistrate.com/control-plane-demystified) as the foundation for PeriGridAI™, allowing them to build
    their application once and offer it via any delivery model their customers required.

  <SectionHeading>Why PeriNimble Selected Omnistrate</SectionHeading>
  <SectionText>
    PeriNimble's leadership team recognized that winning in the AI-driven energy market required elite focus. They chose
    Omnistrate because it was the only solution that abstracted away the entire complexity of software distribution.
    <br />
    While PeriNimble's engineers focused on AI-powered load forecasting and anomaly detection, Omnistrate's control
    plane provided the automated, multi-cloud, and tenant-aware infrastructure needed to securely run those workloads
    anywhere. The decision was simple and, according to its CTO, the 'best one the company had made'.
