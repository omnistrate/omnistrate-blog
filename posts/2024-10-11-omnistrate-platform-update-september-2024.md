## Product updates


![Omnistrate features][2]

We‚Äôre thrilled to introduce several powerful updates that enhance the Omnistrate platform!

Seamlessly turn your application from a **GitHub repository into a fully functioning Software as a Service**. With a few simple steps, you can import your codebase and deploy it directly on the Omnistrate platform, accelerating your time to market.

Gain deeper **Operational insights** into your deployments with our new Debug Events. Track issues in real time and debug your services more efficiently with enhanced visibility into what is happening with your service. 

We‚Äôve added support for **Bring Your Terraform** (or OpenTofu), allowing you to build your Cloud Service by importing existing Terraform stacks. This is in addition to the ability to import container images, Docker images, and Operators, Helm and Kustomize charts, offering more flexibility in how you set up your service.

**Additional Improvements:**

- Custom AWS Policy: Custom policies allow provisioning cloud provider services as part of your service deployment.
- Add User Name in Webhook Notification: Get more contextual notifications by including the username in webhook messages.
- Prevent Resource Deprecation/Deletion through Compose: Added safeguards to prevent unintended resource removal.
- Summary Emails by Environment: Get better insights on your weekly summary emails including Production stats and active alerts.
- UX improvements:
    - Quota Enforcement: "Create instance" button is now disabled when users exceed their quota instead of failing after selection.
    - Merge Serverless Proxy & Resource Instance Page: Streamlining management by merging these pages.
    - Environment Card Service Plan Summary: Quickly review service plan details on environment cards.
    - Specify Services/Environments for SaaSBuilder: More control over specifying which services or environments are targeted within SaaSBuilder.
    - K8s Cluster Role Setup for Human Operations: Better instructions to configure role-based access setup to Kubernetes clusters. 
    - Explore these new features today and elevate your SaaS experience with Omnistrate!
