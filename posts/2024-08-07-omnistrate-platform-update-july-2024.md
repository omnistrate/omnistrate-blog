### Did you get a chance to read about our amazing customer & partner [Convoy][13]?


Convoy partnered with Omnistrate to turn their Open Core Webhook gateway into a feature complete multi-cloud SaaS solution in weeks.  We published a joint case study that you can read here:  [Convoy Case Study][14]

> ‚ÄúIt took our  friends at another company 2 years to build their
> control plane using Vanilla AWS APIs. Omnistrate enabled us to ship
> our Cloud platform in only two weeks, and after Omnistrate, we saw a
> 200% increase in active users.‚Äù [Subomi Oluwalana][15] CEO, Convoy
