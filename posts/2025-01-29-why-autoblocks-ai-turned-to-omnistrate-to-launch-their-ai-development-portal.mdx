    Autoblocks helps companies develop and validate AI applications before they reach production. Its platform enables
    teams to simulate real-world scenarios, evaluate model behavior, and continuously improve AI performance with
    real-world scenarios and subject matter expert (SME) feedback.
    <br />
    Autoblocks had validated market traction, but scaling to enterprise buyers revealed four major friction points:

        Very early on, prospects were asking if they could run Autoblocks in their own cloud.
        <br />
        <br />
        Before Omnistrate, supporting that was a non-starter; now it's a pretty simple check the box.

  <SectionHeading>Omnistrate's SaaS Control Plane</SectionHeading>
  <SectionText>
    To meet enterprise demand for secure, customer-controlled deployments, Autoblocks needed a scalable way for
    customers to run its AI testing platform within their own cloud environments. Rather than building this complex
    infrastructure from scratch, Autoblocks partnered with Omnistrate.
    <br />
    Autoblocks used Omnistrate's powerful Agentic Control Plane as a Service to power the [Autoblocks Deployment
    Portal](https://www.autoblocks.ai/blog/deployment-portal) — a self-service environment where enterprise customers
    can deploy, manage, and monitor Autoblocks directly in their own cloud infrastructure, all with centralized
    visibility and automated lifecycle management.

        For a small team at our stage, [ building out that control plane infrastructure] would have taken up all of our
        time. So Omnistrate was a pretty clear decision. Now we're spending all of our time actually building and
        iterating on our product.
