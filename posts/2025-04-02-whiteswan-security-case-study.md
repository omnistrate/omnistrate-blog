Security-focused startups today face a fundamental shift: enterprise buyers are demanding solutions that are not only secure, but also cloud-native, fast to deploy, and flexible across their multi-cloud environments. This case-study explores why adopting a BYOA deployment model and automating OnPrem tooling are critical for security companies, and how Whiteswan Security partnered with Omnistrate to bring their cloud offering to market faster.


### How Whiteswan Partnered with Omnistrate

Whiteswan Identity Security provides a modern Zero Trust platform that delivers:

- Identity-first privileged access
- Agent-based enforcement
- Real-time detection and ITDR

Whiteswan knew that to reach the enterprise market faster—and deliver it into any cloud environment—they also wanted to focus their engineering efforts on building their core Security Application. That’s why they partnered with Omnistrate.


### Why BYOA Deployment Matters for Security Startups

Security solutions are increasingly expected to be delivered via BYOA—this model accelerates customer onboarding, enables continuous updates, and supports usage-based pricing models and integration with Cloud Marketplaces which is favored by enterprise buyers.

**Key BYOA Advantages:**

- Faster Deployment: Instant provisioning and onboarding
- Continuous Delivery: Always up-to-date with no customer-side patching
- Scalable & Elastic: Meets the needs of growing or global workloads
- Lower Barrier to Entry: Reduces upfront infrastructure investment.

There are cases where the BYOA model mayn’t work due to strict security requirements. In those cases as well, it's important to automate OnPrem deployments/upgrades to streamline support operations.


### The Importance of Multi-Cloud Compatibility


Most large enterprises today operate across multiple cloud platforms to avoid vendor lock-in, increase redundancy, and optimize costs. If your security solution only runs on one cloud, you're already excluded from many organizations' considerations.

To win in this space, startups must offer a cloud-agnostic experience—either running as a true SaaS platform across clouds or being deployable directly into a customer’s own cloud environment.


### Why Omnistrate?


Creating a SaaS control plane from scratch is technically complex and financially daunting, and is also a never ending, ever evolving workstream..
