## üöÄ Exciting New Features in Omnistrate


![Omnistrate Updates](https://mcusercontent.com/08ffbac64293e1abc50999571/images/f018c676-784a-f2ee-0b93-afd832fbade5.png)

**End-customer SSO support in SaaSPortal** 

End-customer SSO support in SaaSPortal enables it to easily integrate with your customers‚Äô Identity Provider (IdP), allowing secure and unified access management. By linking a customer‚Äôs IdP‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs Okta, Azure AD, or any OIDC-compliant provider‚Äîusers can authenticate using their existing enterprise credentials. This ensures a frictionless login experience for end-users while giving administrators full control over user provisioning, access policies, and session security. SaaSPortal handles the SSO configuration and metadata exchange, streamlining onboarding and reducing the burden of identity management for your SaaS product.

**Per-Subscription Pricing**

We‚Äôre excited to announce a major upgrade in our billing system: Per-Subscription Pricing. This powerful new feature allows you to customize pricing at the individual subscription level, giving you the flexibility to support customer-specific exceptions that are especially common during new product launches or pilot programs. Whether it‚Äôs offering tailored discounts, special rates for strategic partners, or custom packages for early adopters, Per-Tenant Pricing ensures your billing can adapt to real-world go-to-market needs without disrupting your standard pricing tiers.

**Isolated Kubernetes (K8s)**

We‚Äôre introducing a new level of tenant isolation with Isolated Kubernetes (K8s). In addition to our existing isolation options at the pod, VM, and account levels (including Bring Your Own Account), you can now run each service in its own dedicated Kubernetes installation. This model is especially valuable for large, complex systems that require cluster-level features, advanced networking, or dedicated shared resources. Isolated K8s gives you another powerful way to package and distribute your services while maintaining high-level abstractions‚ÄîOmnistrate continues to manage the infrastructure so you can focus on your product, not the plumbing.

**Additional Improvements**

- **Enhanced UX Navigation**: We‚Äôve rolled out major UX updates to make Omnistrate more intuitive and aligned with your workflows.

- **Support for BYO payment channel**: Empowers each subscription to be linked with a distinct payment method, enabling flexible integration with your pre-existing billing systems. Allows mapping subscriptions to external billing systems using a custom payer ID.

- **Support for adding custom taints**: Introduces the ability to add taints to Kubernetes node groups, giving you finer control over workload placement and resource segregation when distributing services via Helm or Kuztomize.

- **Improved support for private deployments**: Let your customers toggle deployments between publicly accessible endpoints and private network-restricted modes to meet security or compliance requirements in a self served way.

- **Improved build experience with dry-run capability**: Introduces an early validation command for service plan updates, allowing teams to safely preview changes, catch misconfigurations early, and increase confidence in CI/CD rollouts.

- **GitHub Actions integration for Build from Repository**: Enables full automation of builds from code repositories as part of your CI/CD pipeline, improving development velocity and consistency.

- **Identity Provider (IdP) configuration supported per environment**: Allows the SaaSBuilder for your different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod) to connect with distinct IdPs, supporting varied authentication strategies for your team.

- **Optimized onboarding for GCP accounts**: Delivers a 10x faster time in initial provisioning time for new accounts and connect/disconnect latency for Onpremise Copilot deployments.

- **Configurable Root EBS Volume Size and Instance Types**: Allows you to define the root volume size and instance type per deployment using input parameters‚Äîenabling tailored storage allocation that matches the specific needs of each workload and improving resource efficiency.

- **Storage Usage Alerting**: Adds proactive alerting on storage consumption thresholds, enabling early intervention before reaching critical disk space limits and ensuring consistent service availability.

- **System-Wide Performance Optimizations**: Platform-level improvements have significantly reduced latency across APIs and the UI, delivering a faster, smoother, and more responsive user experience.

**Other UX improvements**

  - Customer portal dashboard now includes detailed deployment insights.

  - Users can now view detailed version info during upgrades and in upgrade history for better context.

  - The selected environment is now preserved when switching between services.

  - In the Fleet dashboard honeycomb chart, instance IDs are now clickable on hover for quicker access.

  - System-managed serverless proxy deployment instances can now be deleted manually.

  - Invoice list now includes Org ID, User Name, and User ID for easier identification.

  - Deprecated versions are hidden by default when launching an instance but can be revealed with a toggle.
