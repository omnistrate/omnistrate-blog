We are delighted to announce that Omnistrate has successfully completed its annual SOC 2 Type II attestation, a significant milestone in our ongoing commitment to safeguarding our customers' data. This achievement demonstrates our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of security, accessibility, and confidentiality.

**Understanding the Importance of SOC 2 Type II Annual Attestation**

SOC 2 Type II compliance is an ongoing process, not just a one-time achievement. The annual attestation requires a detailed review by external auditors, who assess how effectively our controls have been maintained over the past year. This rigorous process ensures that we're continuously meeting the stringent standards necessary to protect customer's data.

**Our Ongoing Security Commitment**

We've put forth a lot of effort to improve our security procedures ever since [receiving][1] our first SOC 2 Type I attestation. [Achieving][2] SOC 2 Type II proved that our controls are robust and regularly enforced, which was a significant accomplishment. This year's successful attestation serves as a testament to our commitment to these stringent standards and our ability to safeguard customer data effectively.

**Strengthening Security and Innovation**

Although we are pleased with this achievement, our attention is now directed towards what lies ahead. Security and compliance are at the core of everything we do, and we’re constantly working to improve our practices to stay ahead of emerging threats. This annual attestation is a testament to our team’s dedication, and we’re committed to maintaining this standard of excellence.
