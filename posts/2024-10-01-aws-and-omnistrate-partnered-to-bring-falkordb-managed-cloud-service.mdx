  <SectionText>
    FalkorDB provides a blazing-fast graph database built for modern AI applications. With the explosion of data-hungry
    Large Language Models (LLMs), FalkorDB saw a critical opportunity within the <b>$200B GenAI market</b>: to power the
    next wave of AI applications, such as GraphRAG and advanced security analytics, with its ultra-low-latency database.
    <br />
    To seize this opportunity, they needed to move beyond an open-source model and offer their product as a fully
    managed, multi-cloud SaaS. This would allow them to target the 90% of enterprises operating in multi-cloud
    environments and provide the ease of use, scalability, and security that modern AI teams demand.
    <br />
    This strategic goal, however, was blocked by a massive engineering hurdle. Launching a true multi-cloud SaaS product
    required building a sophisticated control plane from the ground up—a project that would divert critical resources
    from their core database technology.

  <SectionHeading>Why FalkorDB Selected Omnistrate</SectionHeading>
  <SectionText>
    FalkorDB's leadership (CTO, VP Eng) needed more than just a tool; they needed a strategic partner to accelerate
    their vision. They chose Omnistrate over a costly and slow DIY approach because Omnistrate is a "developer framework
    that enables modern software companies to build and distribute their Software...in days, not years".
    <br />
    Omnistrate provided the fastest, most secure, and most capital-efficient path to market. It allowed FalkorDB to
    "focus on what matters most: innovating on their core applications" while Omnistrate handled the entire complexity
    of SaaS distribution and operations.
