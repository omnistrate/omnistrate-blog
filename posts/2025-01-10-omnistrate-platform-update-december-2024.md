We’re thrilled to introduce several powerful updates that enhance the Omnistrate platform!

Omnistrate now supports automated **Custom DNS setup for Helm, Operators, and Kustomize resources,** just like it does for Docker Compose or Container images. This allows your customers to configure an alias on their own domain when creating a service instance. Omnistrate handles HTTPS support and certificate management seamlessly, saving you time and effort.


We upgraded the Day-2 experience to provide **better incident management and empower quicker resolutions** by providing more incident details at a glance, showing root causes of errors directly in the alarm notifications and allowing quick navigation, providing access to problematic instances via direct links in alarms or PagerDuty.



Based on customer feedback, we've enhanced **Admin Role permissions**. Admins can now manage Cloud Accounts, configure Team Roles and permissions, and oversee Customer Organizations. Previously restricted to the Root Role, these actions can now be delegated to team members with Admin Role for greater flexibility and efficiency.



***Deprecation Notice:*** In 30 days from this notice, we are removing the capability to on-board Cloud Account with Terraform for AWS, taking Cloud Formation as a preferred method for you to onboard new AWS Cloud Accounts on Omnistrate and for your customers to onboard new AWS accounts. This change is to ensure we enable the best experience during onboarding and updating of IAM policies. This will not affect existing onboarded accounts, but the existing Terraform stack will not be updated to support new features

**Additional Improvements:**

- **No-Code Multi-Service Orchestration:** Easily coordinate multiple services per tenant, automating scenarios like provisioning on both the cloud provider and customer accounts.
- **Enhanced Helm Customization:** Helm now supports additional parameters like custom arguments and wait, giving you greater flexibility.
- **Improved Google Cloud Account Verification:** Verification status now provides clearer insights, streamlining setup for both Service Provider hosted and BYOA services.
- **Instance Type Configuration for Helm:** Helm resources now allow multiple instance types, enabling you to select the right configuration for each resource.
- **Streamlined Terraform Resources:** Terraform resources can now be restricted to a single cloud provider when needed, simplifying management for single-cloud setups.
- **Network Type Visibility:** UI and API responses now specify whether service offerings support internal or public networks.
- **Optimized Node Pool Cleanup:** Improved logic prevents hitting cloud provider limits during development experimentation.
- **Managed S3 Storage:** S3 buckets are now treated as managed resources, allowing them to be mapped to multiple service components.
- **Open-source SaaSBuilder enhancements:**
    - Search support on the Nodes Tab
    - Enhanced summary headers for better readability on the Backup Tab
    - Disabled service plan subscriptions are now hidden to reduce confusion
- **Other UX improvements:**
    - Users can now edit previously disabled service plans
    - Cluster access details for BYOA accounts are now displayed on the Host Clusters page
    - Standardize sorting and filtering across various views for consistency
    - When landing on the Instance Details page for a deleted instance, users now see a more descriptive messages
