**Case Study: How Autoblocks.ai Leveraged Omnistrate to Enable Simple Application Deployments into Their Customerâ€™s Cloud Accounts**

##Company Overview##

Autoblocks is a leading platform for AI application development, offering a robust framework for building, managing, and deploying AI models. Their core mission is to enable developers to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into their applications while ensuring flexibility in deployment options.

To support enterprise customers looking to deploy AI applications within their own cloud environments, Autoblocks needed to create a scalable, easy-to-use Deployment Portal. Instead of building everything from scratch, they partnered with "Omnistrate" to accelerate their cloud development.

##Challenges##

- **BYOA/BYOC & On-Prem Flexibility**
Enterprise customers demanded full control of their data and infrastructure, requiring Autoblocks to support customer-deployed (BYOA/BYOC) and on-prem environments without increasing operational burden.

- **AI Infrastructure Support**
Running modern AI workloads meant managing GPU-based infrastructure with CUDA, time-sliced job scheduling, and fast model startup. AI workloads also needed to integrate seamlessly with third-party services like Amazon Bedrock to offer enterprise-grade AI capabilities.

- **Cloud Operations at Scale**
As adoption grew, Autoblocks needed to streamline DevOps, SecOps, FinOps, and SRE operationsâ€”ensuring teams could deploy, monitor, and secure environments across multiple customer accounts and clouds with minimal overhead.

- **Cost Visibility & Resource Efficiency**
With GPU costs and AI workloads varying by tenant, Autoblocks needed granular cost insights, per-deployment metrics, and tools to help both internal teams and customers optimize usage.

- **Billing & Marketplace Readiness**
Scaling monetization required support for usage-based billing, SaaS metering, and integration with cloud marketplaces (like AWS) to drive co-sell and reduce friction in enterprise sales.

##The Omnistrate Solution##

Autoblocks partnered with Omnistrate to power a production-grade control plane and operational foundation that delivered:

- **Seamless BYOA/BYOC & On-Prem Deployments**
Autoblocks now offers customer-managed installations with full enterprise control, while still maintaining centralized visibility, upgrades, and licensingâ€”all powered by Omnistrateâ€™s-generated secure, multi-tenant control plane.

- **AI-Native Infrastructure Support**
With GPU-specific capabilities like CUDA, time-slicing, and job orchestration, AI companies can easily deploy and scale AI workloads. Fast model startup and Bedrock integrations are natively supported.

- **Streamlined Ops Across Functions**
Omnistrateâ€™s unified operations framework enabled Autoblocks' DevOps, SRE, and security teams to manage deployments, upgrades, logging, monitoring, and lifecycle workflows in a single pane of glass.

- **Cost Control & Usage Insights**
With built-in cost tracking, Autoblocks gained per-tenant infrastructure visibility, real-time resource utilization (down to the pod and GPU level), and auto-scaling controls to optimize spend.

- **Integrated Billing & Marketplace Support**
The generated Autoblocks control plane allows them to meter usage, automate invoicing, and list in cloud marketplaces with minimal effortâ€”helping unlock new revenue channels and enterprise distribution.

##Business Impact: Faster Time-to-Market & Cost Savings##

By leveraging Omnistrate, Autoblocks:

* ðŸ“ˆ Reduced SaaS development time from 12+ months to weeks.
* ðŸ’° Saved significant engineering costs (no need for large DevOps team).
* ðŸš€ Enabled self-service AI deployments.
* ðŸŒŽ Expanded globally with regional flexibility.
* âš¡ Improved operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Autoblocks focused on core AI innovation, not infrastructureâ€”gaining a strong market edge.
