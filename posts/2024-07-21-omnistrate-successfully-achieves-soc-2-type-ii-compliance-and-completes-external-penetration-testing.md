**Redwood City, California – July 17, 2024** – We are thrilled to announce that Omnistrate, the industry’s leading SaaS Control Plane service provider, has successfully completed an external penetration testing assessment conducted by a reputable third-party firm. This milestone, combined with our achievement of SOC 2 Type II compliance earlier this year, underscores our unwavering commitment to security, transparency, and excellence.

We are committed to continuous improvement and transparency. These milestones are not just about meeting standards; they are about exceeding expectations and setting new benchmarks for the industry. We will continue to invest in our security infrastructure and processes to ensure that Omnistrate remains a trusted partner on your cloud journey.

**Robust Security Validated Through External Penetration Testing**

Security is at the heart of everything we do at Omnistrate. To ensure that our platform meets the highest standards of security, we engaged a third-party firm to conduct a comprehensive external penetration test. The rigorous assessment simulated real-world cyber-attacks to evaluate the resilience of our systems.

**Key Highlights of the Penetration Testing:**

- Thorough Assessment: The testing covered all aspects of our infrastructure, including network security, application security, and data protection measures.
- High Standards Met: The results confirmed that Omnistrate’s security protocols are robust and effective in preventing unauthorized access and potential vulnerabilities.
- Continuous Improvement: The insights gained from the assessment will be used to further enhance our security measures, ensuring we stay ahead of emerging threats.

**Achieving SOC 2 Type II Compliance**

Earlier this year, Omnistrate achieved SOC 2 Type II compliance, a significant accomplishment that demonstrates our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of data security and operational excellence. SOC 2 Type II compliance is a rigorous certification that evaluates an organization’s ability to protect customer data over a sustained period.

For more details, please see [SOC2 type 1][1] and [SOC2 type 2][2] press releases with more information.

**What SOC 2 Type II Compliance Means for Our Customers:**

- Enhanced Trust: Customers can have increased confidence in Omnistrate’s ability to safeguard their data and maintain privacy.
- Operational Excellence: The certification reflects our dedication to maintaining consistent and effective controls over our systems and operations.
- Regulatory Adherence: SOC 2 Type II compliance ensures that we meet stringent industry standards and regulatory requirements, providing peace of mind to our customers and partners.

**Our Commitment to Security and Excellence**

At Omnistrate, we understand that in today’s digital landscape, security and compliance are paramount. Our recent achievements in external penetration testing and SOC 2 Type II compliance are testaments to our proactive approach to safeguarding our platform and protecting our customers’ data.
