In the early days, open source software (OSS) thrived on principles of freedom, collaboration, and innovation. However, as the cloud era dawned, the landscape shifted. Some of the cloud providers began to monetize OSS without necessarily contributing back to its creators. This raised concerns among open source inventors who felt their work was being exploited for profit.

To address this issue, some OSS projects, like MongoDB, adopted new licenses such as the Server Side Public License (SSPL) to prevent cloud providers from leveraging their software without giving back. However, this move inadvertently sparked debates within the open source community and led to fragmentation.

At Omnistrate, we recognize the importance of balancing the principles of open source with the need for sustainability. We believe that creators should have the freedom to choose how they license their software while still being able to monetize their efforts. That's why we're introducing a new approach to cloud management with Omnistrate.

With Omnistrate, creators can democratize control planes and build enterprise-grade cloud offerings quickly and efficiently. By empowering entrepreneurs to monetize their software directly, without sacrificing its openness, we aim to restore the spirit of collaboration in the open source community.

Imagine a world where innovators can focus on pushing boundaries and creating value, knowing that their contributions are respected and rewarded. That's the vision of Omnistrateâ€”a world where open source thrives, and everyone has the opportunity to participate and prosper. Join us on this journey as we redefine what it means to be open source in the cloud era.
