## Robust Security Validated Through External Penetration Testing 

![Top features][4] 

Security is at the heart of everything we do at Omnistrate. To ensure that our platform meets the highest standards of security, we engaged in an additional third-party firm to conduct a comprehensive external penetration test. The rigorous assessment simulated real-world cyber-attacks to evaluate the resilience of our systems.

This milestone, combined with our achievement of SOC 2 Type II compliance earlier this year, underscores our unwavering commitment to security, transparency, and excellence.
