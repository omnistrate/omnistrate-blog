AWS has recently expanded its SaaS co-sell benefits, making them available to all ISV Accelerate partners, including startups. Previously, this program was invite-only, but now, more ISVs have the opportunity to leverage AWS’s vast sales network and funding support.

However, while the door has opened wider, the bar for qualification remains high. Many ISVs struggle not because of their technology, but because navigating AWS’s technical, compliance, and go-to-market (GTM) requirements is challenging.

In this blog, we’ll break down the key challenges ISVs face in AWS’s SaaS co-sell journey and how to overcome them.


### Why ISVs Should Invest in AWS ISV Accelerate


The AWS ISV Accelerate program isn’t just a badge—it’s a strategic advantage for:

- Stronger sales alignment with AWS teams
- Enhanced credibility in the enterprise market
- Faster and more effective GTM execution

However, getting into the program and making the most of it requires careful planning and execution. ISVs must not only meet AWS’s technical and compliance standards but also align their GTM approach to fully unlock the benefits.


### Key Challenges for ISVs in AWS SaaS Co-Sell


1️⃣ Foundational Technical Review (FTR) – More Than Just a Checklist

To pass FTR, ISVs must complete two major requirements:

 - A security report
 - A full cloud assessment

This is where many ISVs hit their first roadblock—misconfigured security policies, inefficient architectures, and compliance gaps can delay ISV Accelerate eligibility, slowing down GTM execution.

2️⃣ APN Customer Engagements (ACE) – Proving Market Traction

AWS doesn’t just onboard ISVs without proof of market fit. To qualify, ISVs must show:

- A validated pipeline of AWS customers
- Alignment with AWS’s sales and co-sell processes
- Compliance with data-sharing requirements

Without a strong ACE pipeline, ISVs struggle to gain AWS sales support, making ISV Accelerate hard to leverage effectively.

3️⃣ AWS Marketplace Listing – A Must-Have, Not an Option

Being listed on the AWS Marketplace is no longer optional—AWS wants ISVs that are ready to transact within its ecosystem. A Marketplace listing enables:

- Streamlined procurement for AWS customers
- Easier integration into AWS billing and co-sell incentives
- Faster deal cycles by leveraging AWS Marketplace commitments

ISVs without a Marketplace listing often face hurdles in securing AWS co-sell support.
