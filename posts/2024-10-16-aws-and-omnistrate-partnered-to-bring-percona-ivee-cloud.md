[Percona][3], known for providing world-class open-source database software, has always been at the forefront of innovation. When they needed a fully-managed user experience for databases, they trusted Omnistrate to bring their vision to life with [Ivee][4], in record time.

It's been truly inspiring to collaborate with a team so committed to enhancing the database user experience globally. 

The journey of bringing this vision to life in such a short time has been remarkable, and we're excited to achieve even more milestones together!

To enable rapid deployment and scalability of Iveeâ€™s fully-managed SaaS offering, Omnistrate leveraged core AWS services. Compute workloads were run on EC2 (or containerized via EKS). We used Amazon S3 for secure backup and asset storage, EBS for block storage, IAM for cross-account secure connectivity while ensuring consistent and efficient infrastructure deployment. Observability was achieved through CloudWatch dashboards and alerts, and all operations were conducted within a secure VPC using IAM and KMS for access control and encryption. Additionally, as an AWS Marketplace and ISV Accelerate partner, Omnistrate delivered Ivee as a trusted, production-grade SaaS solution on AWS.

Here is the architecture:
