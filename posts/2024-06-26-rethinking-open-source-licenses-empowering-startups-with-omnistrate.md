The open-source community has long been driven by principles of collaboration and innovation. However, the evolution of cloud computing and the rise of SaaS have introduced new complexities in licensing and monetization. In the popular article on [Fermyon's blog][1], the importance of rethinking open-source licenses to align with modern distribution models is highlighted. This is where Omnistrate steps in, transforming the way startups can leverage open-source software.

**The Shift in Open Source Licensing**

Traditionally, open-source licenses were designed to promote sharing and collaboration while ensuring that the original creators received recognition. However, as cloud providers have increasingly commercialized open-source projects, there’s been a growing concern about the sustainability of open-source development. To address these challenges, there's a push towards licenses that balance openness with the ability to monetize.

One of the common patterns is the emergence of open core model, where core functionalities are free and open, while additional features and services are monetized. This model addresses sustainability challenges and leverages cloud computing and SaaS distribution.

One of the most common ways to build open core model is to build a SaaS offering but building one is complex, time-consuming and costly. Omnistrate vision is to precisely address this challenge by automating the busy work, empowering developers to focus on the core differentiation and build their next-gen SaaS in no time at one-tenth of the cost. Here’s how Omnistrate supports this vision:
