## üöÄ Exciting New Features in Omnistrate


![Omnistrate Updates](https://mcusercontent.com/08ffbac64293e1abc50999571/images/d3a62aec-c94b-505f-10d3-5cc405b197a3.png)

We‚Äôre thrilled to introduce several powerful updates that enhance the Omnistrate platform!

**Omnistrate Billing**

We‚Äôre excited to launch **Omnistrate Billing**, a fully integrated system to manage product pricing, usage metering, billing calculations, invoicing, and payments. Whether you're offering standard plans or need to handle complex enterprise pricing, the Omnistrate Billing helps you define pricing for your service offerings, track tenant usage, generate invoices, and automate collections. It brings visibility, automation, and flexibility to your monetization workflow, all natively within the Omnistrate platform. Check out how to enable billing for your services by following some simple steps described in our documentation.

**AI Job Framework**

Our new **AI Job Framework** simplifies running distributed, long-running jobs such as model training, batch inference, and data processing. With built-in support for retries, failure handling, and detailed status tracking, it's designed to be robust and reliable out of the box. It integrates seamlessly into your product experience, allowing users to run and monitor complex workloads without managing infrastructure themselves. The framework also supports integration with frameworks like Ray for distributed model training, inference and checkpointing, enabling scalable, resilient AI workloads. Read more about our Job Controller paradigm in our technical blog.

**On-prem Copilot**

Omnistrate‚Äôs **On-prem Copilot** is built to empower support and implementation teams to deliver faster, more consistent solutions for customers operating on their own infrastructure. It addresses critical concerns around security and data sovereignty by operating entirely within the customer‚Äôs environment‚Äîno permanent connection required‚Äîwhile still providing rich guidance and assistance. This dramatically reduces time to adoption, standardizes deployment workflows, and ensures a smooth, repeatable onboarding process. As hybrid cloud and on-prem setups become increasingly common in enterprise AI adoption, On-prem Copilot bridges the gap by offering a secure, intelligent experience that works wherever your customers are. Read more about the challenges of On-prem distribution and how Omnistrate solves these challenges in our blog.


#### Additional Improvements


- If you're looking to **integrate Omnistrate with your existing billing system**, this feature is for you. We now support exporting detailed usage data to both AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage. All usage data across your clouds and services is aggregated into a single bucket, giving you a centralized, structured view to power your own billing workflows and analytics. See the details in our documentation.

- Simplified the **GCP onboarding experience** by removing the need for Terraform, reducing setup time and complexity. As announced in the January newsletter, Cloud Shell is now the only supported mechanism to onboard GCP accounts.

- We‚Äôve **expanded our notification system** with new user and maintenance events to keep you better informed. You can now sign-up to receive notifications when users send subscription invites, revoke user access, and when they unsubscribe. On the fleet maintenance portal, we‚Äôve added notifications for scheduled upgrades and changes in upgrade status. Additionally, you now have the flexibility to control if and when upgrade-related notifications are sent to your customers.

- Other UX improvements:

  - Reorganized the left navigation menu to group similar items together for easier access.

  - Added support for specifying Git commit hashes in Kustomize and Terraform configurations for more controlled and reproducible deployments.

  - Improved the user experience for endpoint configuration screens.

  - Updated labels in SaaS portal configurations to -provide clearer setup instructions.

  - Enabled copying of key identifiers in Cost Insights to simplify troubleshooting and improve searchability.
