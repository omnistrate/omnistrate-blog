![Omnistrate features][2]

**SaaS Portal** has been revamped to deliver a more comprehensive experience to your customers. An improved navigation, simplified subscription management, a global dashboard presenting the distribution of deployed instances across cloud regions, dedicated pages for backups and per-deployment events, enriched deployment details such as HA, Backup, Autoscaling configuration and current load are some of the key improvements. These improvements are immediately available for your SaaS offering, making your UX more effective and user-friendly.

**Omnistrate UI better supports Helm, Terraform, Kustomize and Operators** resources including detailed information during creation, upgrade or modification. All the information required to diagnose problems is now accessible using a convenient UI and without the need of complicated steps to connect and extract information from the Kubernetes clusters. 

Omnistrate now supports **VPC peering** to connect networks in different accounts or regions, allowing private connectivity of resources, without exposing them to public internet. This feature can be used for the Provider Hosted model with Dedicated networks and for the BYOA Hosting model. 

**Additional Improvements:**

- We improved the visual display and content of our Debug Events presenting immediate clear information to help debug problems with your service
- Improved time to recovery in case of network failures or host unavailability, with 50% reduction of mean time to recover 
- Added support for Terraform Private modules
- Released an open source [Go SDK][3] to simplify the interaction with Omnistrate 
- [Omnistrate Open API specs][4] are more accessible 
- New detailed guideline on how to [Create your Own Custom Portal][5] leveraging the power of Omnistrate platform
- Improved support for tools like [Restish][6] to [explore and interact with Omnistrate APIs][7]
- We published schemas for [Service Spec][8] files and [System Parameters][9] to allow you to have validation and autocomplete on your favorite editor while working with your service definition
- Other UX improvements:
    - Auto-approve subscription settings introduced at the service plan level
    - Instance list page auto-refreshes to reflect real-time resource instance status
    - Enhanced service monitoring and improved Omnistrate [service status page][10]

## Open Source updates ##

![OpenSource][15]

Continuing our effort on OpenSource contributions and foster our community, we created two new GitHub organizations:  

- [omnistrate-oss][11] space: This space hosts a variety of projects and tools designed to help developers leverage the full potential of Omnistrate‚Äôs platform. Our goal is to create an ecosystem where contributors can collaborate on building powerful, scalable solutions for cloud-native infrastructure management, continuous delivery, and SaaS development. We encourage community involvement, whether it‚Äôs through code contributions, issue reporting, or sharing ideas to improve our open-source offerings. Some of the projects you can find here are: SaaSBuilder, GitHub Actions, Omnistrate SDK and more

- [omnistrate-community][12] space: The code in these repositories is sourced from the Omnistrate user community and reflects contributions from developers who actively use and enhance the platform. Some example projects are examples on how to set up a DBaaS service, how to use Helm with Omnistrate and how to setup your CI/CD pipeline on Omnistrate.
